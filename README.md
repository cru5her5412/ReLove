# ♻️ ReLove - Give love, Get love

**ReLove** is a full-stack web application that allows users to give away or browse preloved items in their community all while reducing waste and supporting a more sustainable future. Users can post items they no longer need and others can browse and contact the item owners via email or phone. It's a simple, community-driven platform designed to promote reuse and reduce waste and use preloved items in a trusted, local network..

## 📋 Guide

1. At the top-right, above the files, click on the green button saying "Code" to show the drop-down.

2. Choose the preferred link that you want to use to clone the project to your own machine.

3. On your machine's terminal, make a new folder which will house the project locally:

```console
git clone [COPIED LINK HERE]
```

4. Open your IDE, such as VSCode:

```console
code .
```

5. Take some time to look through the folders and familiarise yourself with where everything is. In your terminal, move to the client folder:

```console
cd client
```

6. Now install all dependencies needed:

```console
npm install
```

Now you can develop locally by running:

```console
npm run dev
```
